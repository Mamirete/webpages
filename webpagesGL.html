    <p>My name is Miguel A. Mirete. I am a first year student majoring in <em>Mechanical Engineering</em> at NC State. I chose this major because I have always been interested in engineering since I was <ins>young</ins>. I have also always excelled in the <strong>STEM</strong> subjects, so this gave me the courage to go into engineering.</p>

    <!-- Paragraph about my current and dream job -->
    <p style="font-family: Arial; font-weight: bold; text-align: center; color: ##FF00FF">My current job is as Sales Associate in Adidas. This summer I'm going to be working as a lifeguard in a town pool in New York. I will work there instead of Adidas. Being a Sales Associate in Adidas has been my only job.</p>
